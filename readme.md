# Paint
This is a small web based drawing test app, it's a concept for drawing on mobile devices.

The problem with drawing in a phone is that you can't exactly see where your
finger is touching, and hence you don't know exactly what you are going to
draw until you raise your finger from the screen.

The idea is that the app don't start drawing until you move your finger a litle bit, so
you can see exactly the point where you will paint, and then the brush will follow the
finger but a litle bit behind, with the same purpose.
